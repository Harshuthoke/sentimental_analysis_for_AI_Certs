Sentiment Analysis API with Groq LLM Integration
Objective:
This project develops a Python-based API that processes customer reviews from XLSX or CSV files, performs sentiment analysis using the Groq Large Language Model (LLM), and returns a structured JSON response with sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).

Features:
Accepts customer reviews in .xlsx or .csv file format.
Uses the Groq API to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Returns a structured JSON response with the sentiment analysis results.
Handles error cases like invalid file format and API errors.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Flask
pandas
openpyxl (for XLSX support)
Groq API integration (langchain_groq)
Gradio (optional, if building a UI)
Installation:
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Groq API key by exporting it as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-groq-api-key'
Usage:
Run the API server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask development server. You can access the API endpoint by visiting http://localhost:5000.

Submit customer reviews for analysis: You can use curl to send a file (CSV or XLSX) for analysis:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_file/customer_reviews.xlsx" http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze
The API will return a JSON response with the sentiment analysis results in the following format:

json
Copy code
{
    "positive": 28,
    "negative": 23,
    "neutral": 0
}
API Endpoint:
Endpoint: /analyze (POST)
Description: Accepts .xlsx or .csv files containing customer reviews.
Returns: A JSON object with the sentiment analysis results (positive, negative, neutral scores).
Example:
Submit a .xlsx file containing 50 customer reviews:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "file=@customer_reviews.xlsx" http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze
Expected JSON output:

json
Copy code
{
    "positive": 28,
    "negative": 23,
    "neutral": 0
}
Limitations:
Sentiment classification accuracy depends on the Groq LLM.
The API does not handle multilingual input.
Large files may take longer to process depending on the file size.
Improvements:
Add support for multilingual sentiment analysis.
Optimize file processing for larger datasets.
Provide more granular sentiment scores for nuanced analysis.
